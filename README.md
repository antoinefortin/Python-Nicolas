# Course Syllabus


### Course description

This series of lectures and courses are designed to show you how to program, this is a not a Python course! I designed this series of classes to fit the average technicians to have a hands-on approach on computer programming. This course is designed  to show you the general concept of programing without going deeply into how the whole machinery works. 
I always wanted to teach programming for none-programmer, but for technical individuals. 
There is no technical prerequistes to this course! Then only thing you need is a desire to learn basic computer programming concept. 
Once you have followed this class, you will have a decent knowledges on how computers works.
